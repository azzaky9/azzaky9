👨‍💻 I'm currently working on a software project to automate business logic for various industries.

🧠 I'm currently active learning Devops and Backend Technologies such as Java, Docker (Swarm), Kubernetes, little bit doing low-level programming, kinda boring doing front-end stuff like a building components and http request.   

🪼 I'm looking to collaborate on open source project if you want me to contribute for your open source project I would be very happy if I could make a contribution to help many people. 

⚡️ Fun fact?, I hate JavaScript 🚮.
