I'm a college student majoring in Information Technology, diving into software development.
I work with JavaScript and TypeScript for both front-end and back-end tasks.
Next.js is my go-to for building user-friendly websites.
Currently, I'm learning DevOps and back-end development, mastering Express.js and Prisma for server-side apps and databases.
TypeScript is my trusty tool for writing strong, reliable code.
